# VSCode Settings
This part of the resource repository is for sharing __handy vscode settings__. 


## 1. Using the settings
To use the different VSCode settings, download the `.json` that you would like to use, rename it to `settings.json` and place
it at `.vscode/settings.json` in your project workspace.

For some of the settings to work, you might need to download extra VSCode extensions. In order to see
which extensions you need to install, you can open the `settings.json` file in VSCode and then hover over the different lines. 
Lines that are inactive due to missing extensions will be slightly darkened and if you hover over VSCode will display an 
`unknown module` tooltip. You can then simply type the name in the VSCode extensions downloader and download it from there.


## 2. Contributing
If you want to contribute useful settings, please give your `settings.json` file a 
meaningful name and ideally comment on what the settings do.
